<p>This is the usage of the United States Government Printing Office and of the Oxford University Press.

<p>Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in <i>-es</i> and <i>-is,</i> the possessive <i>Jesus',</i> and such forms as <i>for conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake.</i> But such forms as <i>Achilles' heel, Moses' laws, Isis' temple</i> are commonly replaced by

<tr><td>honest, energetic, but headstrong</td></tr>

</center>
<p>This is also the usage of the Government Printing Office and of the Oxford University Press.

<p>In the names of business firms the last comma is omitted, as
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 >

</center>
<p>The abbreviation <i><a href="strunk3.html#15">etc</a>.,</i> even if only a single term comes before it, is always preceded by a comma.

<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="3">Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas</a>.</b></font>
<p>

<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as <i><a href="strunk3.html#21">however</a>,</i> or a brief phrase, is or is not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the interruption be slight or considerable, he must never omit one comma and leave the other. Such punctuation as

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 >
<tr><td>Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday,</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>or

<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 >
<tr><td>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health,</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>is indefensible.

<p>Non-restrictive relative clauses are, in accordance with this rule, set off by commas.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Similar clauses introduced by <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> are similarly punctuated.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,</i> is a few miles from Bridgewater.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>In these sentences the clauses introduced by <i>which, when,</i> and <i>where</i> are non-restrictive; they do not limit the application of the words on which they depend, but add, parenthetically, statements supplementing those in the principal clauses. Each sentence is a combination of two statements which might have been made independently.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more interested.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Coleridge wrote <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> at Nether Stowey. Nether Stowey is only a few miles from Bridgewater.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Restrictive relative clauses are not set off by commas.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In this sentence the relative clause restricts the application of the word <i>candidate</i> to a single person. Unlike those above, the sentence cannot be split into two independent statements.

<p>The abbreviations <i><a href="strunk3.html#15">etc</a>.</i> and <i>jr.</i> are always preceded by a comma, and except at the end of a sentence, followed by one.

<p>Similar in principle to the enclosing of parenthetic expressions between commas is the setting off by commas of phrases or dependent clauses preceding or following the main clause of a sentence. The sentences quoted in this section and under Rules <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#16">16</a>, and <a href="#18">18</a> should afford sufficient guidance.

<p>If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the first comma before the conjunction, not after it.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="4">Place a comma before <i>and</i> or <i>but</i> introducing an independent clause</a>.</b></font>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Sentences of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to be in need of rewriting. As they make complete sense when the comma is reached, the second clause has the appearance of an after-thought. Further, <i>and,</i> is the least specific of connectives. Used between independent clauses, it indicates only that a relation exists between them without defining that relation. In the example above, the relation is that of cause and result. The two sentences might be rewritten:

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Although the situation is perilous, there is still one chance of escape.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Or the subordinate clauses might be replaced by phrases:

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of escape.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>But a writer may err by making his sentences too uniformly compact and periodic, and an occasional loose sentence prevents the style from becoming too formal and gives the reader a certain relief. Consequently, loose sentences of the type first quoted are common in easy, unstudied writing. But a writer should be careful not to construct too many of his sentences after this pattern (see Rule <a href="#14">14</a>).

<p>Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by <i>as</i> (in the sense of <i>because</i>), <i>for, or, nor,</i> and <i>while</i> (in the sense of <i>and at the same time</i>) likewise require a comma before the conjunction.

<p>If a dependent clause, or an introductory phrase requiring to be set off by a comma, precedes the second independent clause, no comma is needed after the conjunction.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act promptly, there is still one chance of escape.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>For two-part sentences connected by an adverb, see the next section.

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="5">Do not join independent clauses by a comma</a>.</b></font>

<p>If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures.</td></tr>

<tr><td>It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>It is of course equally correct to write the above as two sentences each, replacing the semicolons by periods.
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Stevenson's romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting adventures.</td></tr>

<tr><td>It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>If a conjunction is inserted, the proper mark is a comma (Rule <a href="#4">4</a>).

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures.</td></tr>

<tr><td>It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as <i>accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore,</i> or <i>thus,</i> and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In general, however, it is best, in writing, to avoid using <i>so</i> in this manner; there is danger that the writer who uses it at all may use it too often. A simple correction, usually serviceable, is to omit the word <i>so,</i> and begin the first clause with <i>as:</i>

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible:

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Man proposes, God disposes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="6">Do not break sentences in two</a>.</b></font>

<p>In other words, do not use periods for commas.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.</td></tr>

<tr><td>He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world, and lived in half a dozen countries.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma, and the following word begun with a small letter.

<p>It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly:

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Again and again he called out. No reply.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is warranted, and that he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in punctuation.

<p>Rules <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, and <a href="#6">6</a> cover the most important principles in the punctuation of ordinary sentences; they should be so thoroughly mastered that their application becomes second nature.

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="7">A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject</a>.</b></font>

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The word <i>walking</i> refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman. If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman, he must recast the sentence:

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, nouns in apposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases come under the same rule if they begin the sentence.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>When he arrived (or, On his arrival) in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defence of the city.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the city.</td></tr>

<td valign=top width=50%>Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Without a friend to counsel him, the temptation proved irresistible.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Without a friend to counsel him, he found the temptation irresistible.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous.

<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="8">Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation</a>.</b></font>

<p>If there is room at the end of a line for one or more syllables of a word, but not for the whole word, divide the word, unless this involves cutting off only a single letter, or cutting off only two letters of a long word. No hard and fast rule for all words can be laid down. The principles most frequently applicable are:

<ol type=a>
<li>Divide the word according to its formation:

<b>
<a name="III">
<font size="+3">III. E</font><font size="+1">LEMENTARY </font><font size="+3">P</font><font size="+1">RINCIPLES OF </font><font size="+3">C</font><font size="+1">OMPOSITION</font></a>
</b>
</center>
<ol>
<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li value=9><a name="9">Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic</a>.</b></font>

<p>If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to treat it very briefly, there may be no need of subdividing it into topics. Thus a brief description, a brief summary of a literary work, a brief account of a single incident, a narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea, any one of these is best written in a single paragraph. After the paragraph has been written, it should be examined to see whether subdivision will not improve it.

<p>Ordinarily, however, a subject requires subdivision into topics, each of which should be made the subject of a paragraph. The object of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader. The beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in the development of the subject has been reached.

<p>The extent of subdivision will vary with the length of the composition. For example, a short notice of a book or poem might consist of a single paragraph. One slightly longer might consist of two paragraphs:

<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Account of the work.
<li>Critical discussion.
</ol>
<p>A report on a poem, written for a class in literature, might consist of seven paragraphs:

<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Facts of composition and publication.
<li>Kind of poem; metrical form.
<li>Subject.
<li>Treatment of subject.
<li>For what chiefly remarkable.
<li>Wherein characteristic of the writer.
<li>Relationship to other works.
</ol>
<p>The contents of paragraphs C and D would vary with the poem. Usually, paragraph C would indicate the actual or imagined circumstances of the poem (the situation), if these call for explanation, and would then state the subject and outline its development. If the poem is a narrative in the third person throughout, paragraph C need contain no more than a concise summary of the action. Paragraph D would indicate the leading ideas and show how they are made prominent, or would indicate what points in the narrative are chiefly emphasized.

<p>A novel might be discussed under the heads:

<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Setting.
<li>Plot.
<li>Characters.
<li>Purpose.
</ol>
<p>A historical event might be discussed under the heads:

<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>What led up to the event.
<li>Account of the event.
<li>What the event led up to.
</ol>
<p>In treating either of these last two subjects, the writer would probably find it necessary to subdivide one or more of the topics here given.

<p>As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. An exception may be made of sentences of transition, indicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or argument.

<p>In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is a paragraph by itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker. The application of this rule, when dialogue and narrative are combined, is best learned from examples in well-printed works of fiction.

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="10">As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning</a>.</b></font>

<p>Again, the object is to aid the reader. The practice here recommended enables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph as he begins to read it, and to retain the purpose in mind as he ends it. For this reason, the most generally useful kind of paragraph, particularly in exposition and argument, is that in which

<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning;
<li>the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence; and
<li>the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence.
</ol>
<p>Ending with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is particularly to be avoided.

<p>If the paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase (<i>again; therefore; for the same reason</i>) in the topic sentence. Sometimes, however, it is expedient to precede the topic sentence by one or more sentences of introduction or transition. If more than one such sentence is required, it is generally better to set apart the transitional sentences as a separate paragraph.

<p>According to the writer's purpose, he may, as indicated above, relate the body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or more of several different ways. He may make the meaning of the topic sentence clearer by restating it in other forms, by defining its terms, by denying the converse, by giving illustrations or specific instances; he may establish it by proofs; or he may develop it by showing its implications and consequences. In a long paragraph, he may carry out several of these processes.

<p>But this device, if too often used, would become a mannerism. More commonly the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject with what the paragraph is to be principally concerned.

<p>The brief paragraphs of animated narrative, however, are often without even this semblance of a topic sentence. The break between them serves the purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail of the action.

<p><br>

</center>

<p>The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>it becomes indefinite: is it the writer, or some person undisclosed, or the world at large, that will always remember this visit?

<p>This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed to-day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The first would be the right form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the Restoration; the second, in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need of making a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to be used.

<p>The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative principally concerned with action, but in writing of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as <i>there is,</i> or <i>could be heard.</i>

<p><center>

<td valign=top width=50%>It has been proved that he was seen to enter the building.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In both the examples above, before correction, the word properly related to the second passive is made the subject of the first.

<p>A common fault is to use as the subject of a passive construction a noun which expresses the entire action, leaving to the verb no function beyond that of completing the sentence.

</center>

<p>The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer's intention.

<p>All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word <i>not.</i> Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express a negative in positive form.

<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="13">Omit needless words</a>.</b></font>

<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

<p>As positive statement is more concise than negative, and the active voice more concise than the passive, many of the examples given under Rules <a href="#11">11</a> and <a href="#12">12</a> illustrate this rule as well.

<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="14">Avoid a succession of loose sentences</a>.</b></font>

<p>This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type, those consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative. Although single sentences of this type may be unexceptionable (see under Rule <a href="#4">4</a>), a series soon becomes monotonous and tedious.

<p>An unskilful writer will sometimes construct a whole paragraph of sentences of this kind, using as connectives <i>and, but,</i> and less frequently, <i>who, which, when, where,</i> and <i>while,</i> these last in non-restrictive senses (see under Rule <a href="#3">3</a>).

<p>Apart from its triteness and emptiness, the paragraph above is bad because of the structure of its sentences, with their mechanical symmetry and sing-song. Contrast with them the sentences in the paragraphs quoted under Rule <a href="#10">10</a>, or in any piece of good English prose, as the preface (<a href="vf.html">Before the Curtain</a>) to <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

<p>If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses--whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.

<p><br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="15">Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form</a>.</b></font>

<p>This principle, that of parallel construction, requires that expressions of similar content and function should be outwardly similar. The likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily the likeness of content and function. Familiar instances from the Bible are the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and the petitions of the Lord's Prayer.

<p>The unskilful writer often violates this principle, from a mistaken belief that he should constantly vary the form of his expressions. It is true that in repeating a statement in order to emphasize it he may have need to vary its form. For illustration, see the paragraph from Stevenson quoted under Rule <a href="#10">10</a>. But apart from this, he should follow the principle of parallel construction.

<p>The left-hand version gives the impression that the writer is undecided or timid; he seems unable or afraid to choose one form of expression and hold to it. The right-hand version shows that the writer has at least made his choice and abided by it.

<p>By this principle, an article or a preposition applying to all the members of a series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.

</center>

<p>Correlative expressions (<i>both, and; not, but; not only, but also; either, or; first, second, third;</i> and the like) should be followed by the same grammatical construction. Many violations of this rule can be corrected by rearranging the sentence.

<p>It may be asked, what if a writer needs to express a very large number of similar ideas, say twenty? Must he write twenty consecutive sentences of the same pattern? On closer examination he will probably find that the difficulty is imaginary, that his twenty ideas can be classified in groups, and that he need apply the principle only within each group. Otherwise he had best avoid the difficulty by putting his statements in the form of a table.

<p>

<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="16">Keep related words together</a>.</b></font>

<p>The position of the words in a sentence is the principal means of showing their relationship. The writer must therefore, so far as possible, bring together the words, and groups of words, that are related in thought, and keep apart those which are not so related.

<p>The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning.

<p>The objection is that the interposed phrase or clause needlessly interrupts the natural order of the main clause. This objection, however, does not usually hold when the order is interrupted only by a relative clause or by an expression in apposition. Nor does it hold in periodic sentences in which the interruption is a deliberately used means of creating suspense (see examples under Rule <a href="#18">18</a>).

<p>The relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after its antecedent.

<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="17">In summaries, keep to one tense</a>.</b></font>

<p>In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he should preferably use the present, though he may use the past if he prefers. If the summary is in the present tense, antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect; if in the past, by the past perfect.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>An unforeseen chance prevents Friar John from delivering Friar Lawrence's letter to Romeo. Juliet, meanwhile, owing to her father's arbitrary change of the day set for her wedding, has been compelled to drink the potion on Tuesday night, with the result that Balthasar informs Romeo of her supposed death before Friar Lawrence learns of the nondelivery of the letter.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>But whichever tense be used in the summary, a past tense in indirect discourse or in indirect question remains unchanged.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>The Legate inquires who struck the blow.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Apart from the exceptions noted, whichever tense the writer chooses, he should use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution (compare Rule <a href="#15">15</a>).

<p>In presenting the statements or the thought of some one else, as in summarizing an essay or reporting a speech, the writer should avoid intercalating such expressions as "he said," "he stated," "the speaker added," "the speaker then went on to say," "the author also thinks," or the like. He should indicate clearly at the outset, once for all, that what follows is summary, and then waste no words in repeating the notification.

<p>In notebooks, in newspapers, in handbooks of literature, summaries of one kind or another may be indispensable, and for children in primary schools it is a useful exercise to retell a story in their own words. But in the criticism or interpretation of literature the writer should be careful to avoid dropping into summary. He may find it necessary to devote one or two sentences to indicating the subject, or the opening situation, of the work he is discussing; he may cite numerous details to illustrate its qualities. But he should aim to write an orderly discussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment. Similarly, if the scope of his discussion includes a number of works, he will as a rule do better not to take them up singly in chronological order, but to aim from the beginning at establishing general conclusions.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b><li><a name="18">Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end</a>.</b></font>

<p>The proper place for the word, or group of words, which the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end of the sentence.

<td valign=top width=50%>Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The word or group of words entitled to this position of prominence is usually the logical predicate, that is, the <i>new</i> element in the sentence, as it is in the second example.

<p>The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence which it gives to the main statement.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, one of the Italian mariners whom the decline of their own republics had put at the service of the world and of adventure, seeking for Spain a westward passage to the Indies as a set-off against the achievements of Portuguese discoverers, lighted on America.</td></tr>

<tr><td>With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourselves unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful prosecution of this war.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, becomes emphatic when placed first.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>Deceit or treachery he could never forgive.</td></tr>

<tr><td>So vast and rude, fretted by the action of nearly three thousand years, the fragments of this architecture may often seem, at first sight, like works of nature.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>A subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic, but hardly by its position alone. In the sentence,

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Great kings worshipped at his shrine,</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>the emphasis upon <i>kings</i> arises largely from its meaning and from the context. To receive special emphasis, the subject of a sentence must take the position of the predicate.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream.</td></tr>

<p>The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the sentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a composition.
