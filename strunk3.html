<dt><dd>(Many of the words and expressions here listed are not so much bad English as bad style, the commonplaces of careless writing. As illustrated under <i>Feature,</i> the proper correction is likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of words by another, but the replacement of vague generality by definite statement.)
</dl>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<ul type=square>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="1">All right.</b></font> Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense, "Agreed," or "Go ahead." In other uses better avoided. Always written as two words.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="2">As good or better than.</b></font> Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentence.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>My opinion is as good or better than his.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>My opinion is as good as his, or better (if not better).</td></tr>

</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="3">As to whether.</b></font> <i>Whether</i> is sufficient; see under <a href="strunk.html#13">Rule 13</a>.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="4">Bid.</b></font> Takes the infinitive without <i>to.</i> The past tense is <i>bade.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="5">Case.</b></font> The <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i> begins its definition of this word: "instance of a thing's occurring; usual state of affairs." In these two senses, the word is usually unnecessary.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>

<td valign=top width=50%>Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated.</td></tr>

</table>
</center>

<p>See Wood, <i>Suggestions to Authors,</i> pp. 68-71, and Quiller-Couch, <i>The Art of Writing,</i> pp. 103-106.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="6">Certainly.</b></font> Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use <i><a href="#44">very</a>,</i> to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in writing.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="7">Character.</b></font> Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Acts of a hostile character</td>
<td>Hostile acts</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="8">Claim, vb.</b></font> With object-noun, means <i>lay claim to.</i> May be used with a dependent clause if this sense is clearly involved: "He claimed that he was the sole surviving heir." (But even here, "claimed to be" would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute for <i>declare, maintain,</i> or <i>charge.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="9">Compare.</b></font> To <i>compare to</i> is to point out or imply resemblances, between objects regarded as essentially of different order; to <i>compare with</i> is mainly to point out differences, between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="10">Clever.</b></font> This word has been greatly overused; it is best restricted to ingenuity displayed in small matters.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="11">Consider.</b></font> Not followed by <i>as</i> when it means, "believe to be." "I consider him thoroughly competent." Compare, "The lecturer considered Cromwell first as soldier and second as administrator," where "considered" means "examined" or "discussed."

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="12">Dependable.</b></font> A needless substitute for <i>reliable, trustworthy.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="13">Due to.</b></font> Incorrectly used for <i>through, because of,</i> or <i>owing to,</i> in adverbial phrases: "He lost the first game, due to carelessness." In correct use related as predicate or as modifier to a particular noun: "This invention is due to Edison;" "losses due to preventable fires."

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="14">Effect.</b></font> As noun, means <i>result;</i> as verb, means <i>to bring about, accomplish</i> (not to be confused with <i>affect,</i> which means "to influence").

<p>As noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music, painting, and other arts: "an Oriental effect;" "effects in pale green;" "very delicate effects;" "broad effects;" "subtle effects;" "a charming effect was produced by." The writer who has a definite meaning to express will not take refuge in such vagueness.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="15">Etc.</b></font> Not to be used of persons. Equivalent to <i>and the rest, and so forth,</i> and hence not to be used if one of these would be insufficient, that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to objection when it represents the last terms of a list already given in full, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation.

<p>At the end of a list introduced by <i>such as, for example,</i> or any similar expression, <i>etc.</i> is incorrect.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="16">Fact.</b></font> Use this word only of matters of a kind capable of direct verification, not of matters of judgment. That a particular event happened on a given date, that lead melts at a certain temperature, are facts. But such conclusions as that Napoleon was the greatest of modern generals, or that the climate of California is delightful, however incontestable they may be, are not properly facts.

<p>On the formula <i>the fact that,</i> see under <a href="strunk.html#13">Rule 13</a>.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="17">Factor.</b></font> A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it forms part can usually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic.

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>His superior training was the great factor in his winning the match.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He won the match by being better trained.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Heavy artillery is becoming an increasingly important factor in deciding battles.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Heavy artillery is playing a larger and larger part in deciding battles.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="18">Feature.</b></font> Another hackneyed word; like <i><a href="#17">factor</a></i> it usually adds nothing to the sentence in which it occurs.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>A feature of the entertainment especially worthy of mention was the singing of Miss A.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>(Better use the same number of words to tell what Miss A. sang, or if the programme has already been given, to tell something of how she sang.)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>As a verb, in the advertising sense of <i>offer as a special attraction,</i> to be avoided.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="19">Fix.</b></font> Colloquial in America for <i>arrange, prepare, mend.</i> In writing restrict it to its literary senses, <i>fasten, make firm or immovable,</i> etc.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="20">He is a man who.</b></font> A common type of redundant expression; see <a href="strunk.html#13">Rule 13</a>.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>He is a man who is very ambitious.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He is very ambitious.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Spain is a country which I have always wanted to visit.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>I have always wanted to visit Spain.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="21">However.</b></font> In the meaning <i>nevertheless,</i> not to come first in its sentence or clause.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded in reaching camp.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>When <i>however</i> comes first, it means <i>in whatever way</i> or <i>to whatever extent.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best.</td></tr>
<tr><td>However discouraging the prospect, he never lost heart.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="22">Kind of.</b></font> Not to be used as a substitute for <i>rather</i> (before adjectives and verbs), or except in familiar style, for <i>something like</i> (before nouns). Restrict it to its literal sense: "Amber is a kind of fossil resin;" "I dislike that kind of notoriety." The same holds true of <i>sort of.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="23">Less.</b></font> Should not be misused for <i>fewer.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>He had less men than in the previous campaign.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He had fewer men than in the previous campaign.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><i>Less</i> refers to quantity, <i>fewer</i> to number. "His troubles are less than mine" means "His troubles are not so great as mine." "His troubles are fewer than mine" means "His troubles are not so numerous as mine." It is, however, correct to say, "The signers of the petition were less than a hundred, "where the round number, a hundred, is something like a collective noun, and <i>less</i> is thought of as meaning a less quantity or amount.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="24">Line, along these lines.</b></font> <i>Line</i> in the sense of <i>course of procedure, conduct, thought,</i> is allowable, but has been so much overworked, particularly in the phrase <i>along these lines,</i> that a writer who aims at freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Mr. B. also spoke along the same lines.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Mr. B. also spoke, to the same effect.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>He is studying along the line of French literature.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He is studying French literature.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="25">Literal, literally.</b></font> Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>A literal flood of abuse</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>A flood of abuse</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Literally dead with fatigue</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Almost dead with fatigue (dead tired)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="26">Lose out.</b></font> Meant to be more emphatic than <i>lose,</i> but actually less so, because of its commonness. The same holds true of <i>try out, win out, sign up, register up.</i> With a number of verbs, <i>out</i> and <i>up</i> form idiomatic combinations: <i>find out, run out, turn out, cheer up, dry up, make up,</i> and others, each distinguishable in meaning from the simple verb. <i>Lose out</i> is not.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="27">Most.</b></font> Not to be used for <i>almost.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Most everybody</td>
<td>Almost everybody</td></tr>

<tr><td>Most all the time</td>
<td>Almost all the time</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="28">Nature.</b></font> Often simply redundant, used like <i><a href="#7">character</a>.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Acts of a hostile nature</td>
<td>Hostile acts</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Often vaguely used in such expressions as "a lover of nature;" "poems about nature." Unless more specific statements follow, the reader cannot tell whether the poems have to do with natural scenery, rural life, the sunset, the untracked wilderness, or the habits of squirrels.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="29">Near by.</b></font> Adverbial phrase, not yet fully accepted as good English, though the analogy of <i>close by</i> and <i>hard by</i> seems to justify it. <i>Near,</i> or <i>near at hand,</i> is as good, if not better.

<p>Not to be used as an adjective; use <i>neighboring.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="30">Oftentimes, ofttimes.</b></font> Archaic forms, no longer in good use. The modern word is <i>often.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="31">One hundred and one.</b></font> Retain the <i>and</i> in this and similar expressions, in accordance with the unvarying usage of English prose from Old English times.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name=32">One of the most.</b></font> Avoid beginning essays or paragraphs with this formula, as, "One of the most interesting developments of modern science is, etc.;" "Switzerland is one of the most interesting countries of Europe." There is nothing wrong in this; it is simply threadbare and forcible-feeble.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name=33">People.</b></font> <i>The people</i> is a political term, not to be confused with <i>the public.</i> From the people comes political support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage.

<p>The word <i>people</i> is not to be used with words of number, in place of <i>persons.</i> If of "six people" five went away, how many "people" would be left?

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name=34">Phase.</b></font> Means a stage of transition or development: "the phases of the moon;" "the last phase." Not to be used for <i>aspect</i> or <i>topic.</i>

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>Another phase of the subject</td>
<td>Another point (another question)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name=35">Possess.</b></font> Not to be used as a mere substitute for <i>have</i> or <i>own.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>He possessed great courage.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He had great courage (was very brave).</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>He was the fortunate possessor of</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>He owned</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name=36">Respective, respectively.</b></font> These words may usually be omitted with advantage.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Works of fiction are listed under the names of their respective authors.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Works of fiction are listed under the names of their authors.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and Cummings respectively.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and by Cummings.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In some kinds of formal writing, as in geometrical proofs, it may be necessary to use <i>respectively,</i> but it should not appear in writing on ordinary subjects.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="37">So.</b></font> Avoid, in writing, the use of <i>so</i> as an intensifier: "so good;" "so warm;" "so delightful."

<p>On the use of <i>so</i> to introduce clauses, see <a href="strunk.html#4">Rule 4</a>.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="38">Sort of.</b></font> See under <b><a href="#22">Kind of</a>.</b>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="39">State.</b></font> Not to be used as a mere substitute for <i>say, remark.</i> Restrict it to the sense of <i>express fully or clearly,</i> as, "He refused to state his objections."

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="40">Student body.</b></font> A needless and awkward expression, meaning no more than the simple word <i>students.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>A member of the student body</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>A student</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Popular with the student body</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Liked by the students</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The student body passed resolutions.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>The students passed resolutions.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="41">System.</b></font> Frequently used without need.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Dayton has adopted the commission system of government.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Dayton has adopted government by commission.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The dormitory system</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Dormitories</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="42">Thanking you in advance.</b></font> This sounds as if the writer meant, "It will not be worth my while to write to you again." Simply write, "Thanking you," and if the favor which you have requested is granted, write a letter of acknowledgment.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="43">They.</b></font> A common inaccuracy is the use of the plural pronoun when the antecedent is a distributive expression such as <i>each, each one, everybody, every one, many a man,</i> which, though implying more than one person, requires the pronoun to be in the singular. Similar to this, but with even less justification, is the use of the plural pronoun with the antecedent <i>anybody, any one, somebody, some one,</i> the intention being either to avoid the awkward "he or she," or to avoid committing oneself to either. Some bashful speakers even say, "A friend of mine told me that they, etc."

<p>Use <i>he</i> with all the above words, unless the antecedent is or must be feminine.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="44">Very.</b></font> Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in themselves.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="45">Viewpoint.</b></font> Write <i>point of view,</i> but do not misuse this, as many do, for <i>view</i> or <i>opinion.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="46">While.</b></font> Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for <i>and, but,</i> and <i>although.</i> Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for <i>and</i> or <i>but,</i> either from a mere desire to vary the connective, or from uncertainty which of the two connectives is the more appropriate. In this use it is best replaced by a semicolon.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor, while the rest of the building is devoted to manufacturing.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor; the rest of the building is devoted to manufacturing.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Its use as a virtual equivalent of <i>although</i> is allowable in sentences where this leads to no ambiguity or absurdity.
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>While I admire his energy, I wish it were employed in a better cause.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>This is entirely correct, as shown by the paraphrase,
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>I admire his energy; at the same time I wish it were employed in a better cause.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Compare:

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>

<p>The paraphrase,
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>The temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime; at the same time the nights are often chilly,</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>shows why the use of <i>while</i> is incorrect.

<p>In general, the writer will do well to use <i>while</i> only with strict literalness, in the sense of <i>during the time that.</i>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="47">Whom.</b></font> Often incorrectly used for <i>who</i> before <i>he said</i> or similar expressions, when it is really the subject of a following verb.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>His brother, whom he said would send him the money</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>His brother, who he said would send him the money</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width=50%>The man whom he thought was his friend</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>The man who (that) he thought was his friend (whom he thought his friend)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="48">Worth while.</b></font> Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with <i>not</i>) of disapproval. Strictly applicable only to actions: "Is it worth while to telegraph?"

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>His books are not worth while.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>His books are not worth reading (not worth one's while to read; do not repay reading).</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The use of <i>worth while</i> before a noun ("a worth while story") is indefensible.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<li><font size="+1"><b><a name="49">Would.</b></font> A conditional statement in the first person requires <i>should,</i> not <i>would.</i>

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td>I should not have succeeded without his help.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The equivalent of <i>shall</i> in indirect quotation after a verb in the past tense is <i>should,</i> not <i>would.</i>
<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=350>
<tr><td>He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense, without <i>would,</i> is usually sufficient, and from its brevity, more emphatic.

<p><center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 width=400>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%>Once a year he would visit the old mansion.</td>
<td valign=top width=50%>Once a year he visited the old mansion.</td></tr>
